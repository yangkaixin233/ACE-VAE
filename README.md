# ACE-VAE Project

This repository contains the implementation of the ACE-VAE model, a novel approach for handling tabular data using Variational Autoencoders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `dataset` folder. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the original paper accompanying this code.

## Baseline Models

Our model is compared against several established baselines:
- **GATE**: [Gated Additive Tree Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07425)
- **TabNet**: [TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442)
- **DANet**: [Deep Abstract Networks for Tabular Data Classification and Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07286)
- **AutoInt**: [Automatic Feature Interaction Learning via Self-Attentive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11921)
- **FTTransformer**: [Revisiting Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11959)

## Implementation

The implementation leverages the [pytorch-tabular](https://github.com/manujosephv/pytorch_tabular) library, which provides a framework for building deep learning models for tabular data.

## Future Work

If the accompanying article is published, the entire codebase will be made available in this repository.
